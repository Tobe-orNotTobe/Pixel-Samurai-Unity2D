  playerDialogueLines:
  - Hansho, this ends now. Step away from the boy
  - The dead do not return, Hansho. What you seek is nothing but an empty shell,
    a curse disguised as salvation.
  - You were once an honorable warrior. But now, you've become the very thing we
    swore to destroy.
  bossDialogueLines:
  - "You\u2019re too late, Jiro. The ritual is nearly complete. Soon, the one I lost
    will return to me\u2026 and nothing will stand in my way."
  - And what would you know of loss, old friend? Have you ever watched someone slip
    away before your very eyes, powerless to stop it? I refuse to live in a world
    where fate decides who lives and who dies!
  - "Honor is a chain that binds fools. I will shatter those chains\u2026 even if
    it means cutting you down."
